Extensively Matching for Few-shot Learning Event Detection

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10093


## Data

I couldnt share my preprocessed dataset, you can purchase the data set from LDC https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06
please preprocess the data yourself with the following features

```
indices: Glove/Word2vec indices of the sentence (B,N,K+Q,L)
dist: indices of the relative position embedding (B,N,K+Q,L)
length: length of sentence  (B,N,K+Q,1)
mask: mask (0 mean padding tokens, 1 otherwise) (B,N,K+Q,L)
anchor_index: index of the trigger/anchor word (B,N,K+Q,1)

where 
B is batch size, 
N is number of classes, 
K+Q is the number of sample in the support set and query set per class
L is the max_sentence length
```
